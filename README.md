![Immage of home page](.\Develop\assets\images\horiseon-home-page.png)

- The page had a lot of redundant code that needed to be fixed.
- I decided to work on this project to improve my html and css skills.
- Now that the page is cleaned up it should function the same while being easeier for seach engines to find.
- I learned that it is easy to get messy if you don't stay orginized.
